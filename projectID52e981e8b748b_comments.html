<HTML><BODY><p>This 1910 work by the German author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Drews">Arthur Drews</a> presents numerous arguments for the hypothesis that Christ is a myth, and that no historical Jesus can be identified. Some of its content is highly controversial, not just with Christians, but also with modern atheists (in particular his claims about Hindu influences, and the last part introducing his version of monism). I will provide a somewhat less controversial work on the same theme by John E. Remsburg later on (as far as books making this claim can be non-controversial at all).

<p>Since the work is translated from the German, a lot of reference to German works (in German) appear in the text.
